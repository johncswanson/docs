# Running the Commercial Paper Contract - PaperNet
> An opinionated tutorial showing a best practice approach, using Node.js chaincode

> Written for the 'unstable' branches of Fabric 


## Setup a dev environment. **

This was written using Ubuntu exclusively but the sample approach is valid for other platforms. 

- Node chaincode needs node v8.9.x   (as this uses GRPC that has native modules you'll need python)
- Running fabric will need to have docker
- Development is best with VScode**

It will be useful to have several command windows open: **
- one for showing the logs streamed from the docker containers.
- one for the chaincde (when run in dev mode) and 
= a final one for issuing commands to execute the contract.

First step is to clone this repo to get both the scripts and code for application and contract

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ampretia/fabric-application-examples.git
```

### Getting an 'unstable' build **

As Fabric 1.3 is yet to be a formal release, use the `getEdgeFabricDocker.sh` in the `infrastructure` directory to pull down the master branch docker containers.

```
$ .\fabric-application-examples\infrastructure\getEdgeFabricDocker.sh
```

## Contract Development Deployment

### Start fabric in development mode

We're going to use the **Fabric `basic network` from the `fabric-samples` as the starting point for creating our PAPERNET contract.**

**Within in the 'infrastructure' directory there is a `basic-network` directory. This has a copy of the fabric-samples
basic network.  In that copied directory, there is a minor edit to the `docker-compose` file, to enable the peer into debug mode. 

**Using your editor of choice, find the following lines (one is commented out):

```
    command: peer node start 
    # command: peer node start --peer-chaincodedev=true
```

For debug mode: the line should be `command: peer node start --peer-chaincodedev=true`
For production mode it should be `command: peer node start`

**The next step is start the fabric infrastructure; as we are developing - it is also very useful to be able to watch the output of all the docker containers. This can be done quite easily by using a tool called 'logspout' running in a separate window. From the `infrastructure\basic-network` directory run these commands:

```
$ ./start.sh
$ ../monitor_docker.sh net_basic
```

This window will now show all the docker container output.

### Start the Chaincode

**In another window, you can now start the chaincode from the chaincode directory; this will run as a foreground process that lets you either output debug statements, or connect a debugger such as vscode should you wish.

**We're working with NodeJS chaincode, in this tutorial.

**Change to the `contracts\javascript` directory.

Run an `npm install` to get all the dependencies ready:

```
$ npm install
```

**Next, we can then start the chaincode in development mode:

```
$ CORE_CHAINCODE_ID_NAME=papernet:0 $(npm bin)/fabric-chaincode-node start --peer.address=localhost:7052
```

The `CORE_CHAINCODE_ID_NAME` is needed to identify this running chaincode, and the address of the peer is needed. When the Peer is not in development mode, this is essentially the same code that is used to start contract within the chaincode container. Therefore there is strong fidelity of functionality between dev mode and production. 

### Install and Instantiate the Chaincode

In another window (the third and final one), you can issue the commands to interact with the contract. 

**Firstly, within the same `basic-network`,  directory start the docker container that will handle `cli` commands

```
$ docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml up -d cli 
```

**The commands needed to install and instantiate the chaincode in dev mode are the same as production. Though the install command isn't really functionally needed in dev mode - it is best to keep it. 

```
$ docker exec cli peer chaincode install -n papernet -v 0 -p /opt/gopath/src/github.com/javascript -l node

$ docker exec cli peer chaincode instantiate -n papernet -v 0 -l node -c '{"Args":["org.papernet.commercialpaper.instantiate"]}' -C mychannel
```

## Recap

To this point, we've cloned a sample repo, pulled down the latest code, ** and started a Fabric infrastructure. A contract has been installed on the Fabric peer, and instantiated on the channel.

The next section gets us ready to submit transactions which will exercise the contract transaction functions, using a sample identity from an id wallet.

## Application Start

Change to the `application/nodejs` directory. There are two steps to the application lifecycle.  Firstly a local 'idwallet' needs to be created that contains the credentials for a specific user,  known** to the Fabric infrastructure. The application itself can then issue transactions as that user.

Issue this command to run the app to setup a local folder with the credentials 

```
$ node addToWallet.js
```

**You can then run the application to issue the transactions **(using the identity mentioned) such as issuing, buying and redeeming a Commercial Paper stored on the ledger.

```
$ node application.js
```
